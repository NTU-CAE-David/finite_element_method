# MATLAB-Based Finite Element Analysis Framework

Welcome to the MATLAB-Based Finite Element Analysis Framework repository for ME 7112: FINITE ELEMENT METHOD at National Taiwan University. This repository contains course materials, assignments, and resources related to the course. The primary focus of this course includes linear and nonlinear finite element analysis, as well as mesh generation using tools like `dictMesh()`.

## Course Information

**Course**: ME 7112: FINITE ELEMENT METHOD  
**Instructor**: 王建凱  
**Semester**: Fall 2023

## Contents

### Materials

In this repository, you will find a collection of course materials, lecture notes, and resources essential for understanding the finite element method. These materials cover various topics related to finite element analysis, both linear and nonlinear. They are designed to facilitate your learning and provide valuable insights into the principles and applications of finite element analysis.

### Assignments

This repository includes assignments related to ME 7112. Assignments are an integral part of the course curriculum and serve as practical exercises to apply the concepts learned during the lectures. Detailed instructions for each assignment can be found within their respective directories.

### Mesh Generation

Mesh generation is a crucial aspect of finite element analysis. Additionally, it provides a mesh generator tool that can be found in the `finite_element_method-main` directory. This mesh generator, developed in Python, simplifies the process of discretizing complex geometries. You can access and use this mesh generator program to create finite element meshes for your analysis projects.

Detailed documentation on how to use this mesh generator tool effectively is available within its directory.
